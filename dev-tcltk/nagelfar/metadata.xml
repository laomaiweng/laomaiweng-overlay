    <longdescription>Nagelfar, a static syntax checker for Tcl

Features:
* Written in pure Tcl/Tk. No compilation. If you can run Tcl you can run Nagelfar.
* Extendible. You can add to the syntax database, or let the tool use Tcl's introspection to extract syntax information from any Tcl interpreter. Thus you can test scripts for applications using Tcl as script language.
* Plugins. Even more extendible through plugins that can hook up at certain points in the check flow and do custom checking.
* Severity level filter and glob matching filters to remove errors known to be ok.
* View and edit the checked source directly in Nagelfar.
* Inline comments can help Nagelfar do a better job.
* Code coverage instrumentation. Provides help for simple code coverage analysis.
